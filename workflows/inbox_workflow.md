# spejder.workflows.inbox_workflow

**Purpose:**
Coordinates the ingestion of new job postings from the inbox folder, matching jobs against the database and profile.

**API:**
- `process_inbox`

**Shared ingest helpers:**
- Ingest reporting and inbox file cleanup moved to `spejder.workflows.ingest_utils` and are imported by this module.

**Ingest translation flow:**
- Ingest now builds `entry_transform` through `spejder.workflows.job_enrichment.make_translate_job_entry_for_storage`.
- `process_inbox` owns invocation-scoped `text_translation_cache` and `title_translation_cache` and passes both into the shared factory before `ingest_docs_to_db`.

**Context:**
Extracted from `inbox_parser` to place workflow logic into the proper module group.
